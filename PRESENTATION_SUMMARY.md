# Proxy Configuration Presentation - Ready! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Been Created

I've created a complete, interactive presentation about making Kubernetes operators proxy-aware in OpenShift, formatted for Go's `present` tool to view in your browser.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Start Script (Easiest)
```bash
./start-presentation.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
present
```

Then open your browser to: **http://127.0.0.1:3999** and click on `proxy-configuration.slide`

## Files Created

### Main Presentation
- **`proxy-configuration.slide`** - The main presentation file (Go present format)
- **`PRESENTATION.md`** - Detailed instructions for running and using the presentation
- **`start-presentation.sh`** - Quick start script (already executable)

### Example Code Files (in `proxy-examples/`)
All code examples referenced in the presentation:

**YAML Configuration Files:**
- `ca-configmap.yaml` - User CA bundle example
- `proxy-config.yaml` - Cluster proxy configuration
- `configmap-empty.yaml` - Empty ConfigMap with injection label
- `configmap-injected.yaml` - ConfigMap after CNO injection
- `kustomization.yaml` - Kustomize configuration
- `manager-deployment.yaml` - Operator deployment with CA mount
- `operand-pod.yaml` - Final operand pod with proxy settings

**Go Code Examples:**
- `reconciler-configmap.go` - Creating trusted CA ConfigMap
- `reconciler-proxy.go` - Getting and setting proxy configuration
- `reconciler-volume.go` - Volume and mount management
- `reconciler-apply.go` - Applying proxy to all containers
- `controller-setup.go` - Controller setup with metadata watching
- `controller-predicates.go` - Custom predicates for filtering
- `controller-mapper.go` - Mapping ConfigMaps to owners
- `complete-reconciler.go` - Complete reconciler implementation
- `complete-controller.go` - Complete controller setup
- `precedence.go` - Configuration precedence example
- `graceful.go` - Graceful degradation example

## Presentation Structure

### 1. **Why Proxy Configuration Matters**
- Enterprise network requirements
- Security & compliance needs
- The problem for Kubernetes operators

### 2. **Configuring OpenShift Cluster-Wide Proxy**
- Step-by-step cluster proxy setup
- Creating CA bundles
- Configuring the Proxy resource
- Important noProxy considerations

### 3. **Cluster Network Operator (CNO) Role**
- CNO responsibilities
- CA bundle injection mechanism
- The "magic label": `config.openshift.io/inject-trusted-cabundle: "true"`
- Clear ownership model (CNO owns data, operator owns labels)

### 4. **OLM and Operator Proxy Configuration**
- Automatic environment variable injection
- Creating and mounting trusted CA bundle for operator pod
- Using Kustomize configMapGenerator
- How it all works together

### 5. **Making Operand Pods Proxy-Aware**
- Operator responsibilities
- Creating trusted CA ConfigMap in operand namespace
- Applying proxy environment variables (uppercase + lowercase)
- Mounting certificates
- Supporting init containers

### 6. **Watching ConfigMap Changes Efficiently**
- Why watch metadata only (avoid race conditions with CNO)
- Using `WatchesMetadata` instead of `Watches`
- Predicates for efficient filtering
- Benefits and best practices

### 7. **Complete Example**
- End-to-end walkthrough
- Complete reconciler code
- Controller setup
- Result: fully proxy-aware workloads

### 8. **Summary and Best Practices**
- Implementation checklist
- Best practices for configuration, certificates, and performance
- Advanced topics: precedence and graceful degradation

## Presentation Features

âœ… **Interactive Browser-Based Viewing**
- Navigate with arrow keys or on-screen buttons
- Full-screen mode (press 'F')
- Responsive design

âœ… **Syntax-Highlighted Code**
- All code examples with proper Go/YAML highlighting
- Key lines highlighted with `// HL` comments
- Code can be edited in browser for experimentation

âœ… **Real Working Examples**
- All code is from the actual External Secrets Operator implementation
- Copy-paste ready for your own operators
- Proven patterns and best practices

âœ… **Progressive Learning**
- Starts with "why" - understanding the problem
- Step-by-step progression through the solution
- Complete working example at the end

âœ… **Professional Quality**
- Clean, modern design
- Clear structure and flow
- Suitable for technical presentations or demos

## Key Concepts Covered

### Critical Principles
1. **CNO Ownership Model** - Never modify ConfigMap data, only labels
2. **Metadata-Only Watching** - Use `WatchesMetadata` to avoid race conditions
3. **Dual-Case Environment Variables** - Set both uppercase and lowercase
4. **Init Container Support** - Don't forget init containers need proxy too
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Handle environments without proxy

### Implementation Checklist
The presentation includes comprehensive checklists for:
- Cluster administrators
- Operator developers (operator pod)
- Operator developers (operand pods)
- Controller implementation
- Testing strategies

## Tips for Presenting

### Navigation
- **Arrow Keys**: Move between slides
- **'F' Key**: Full-screen mode
- **'Esc' Key**: Overview of all slides
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last slide

### Code Examples
- Code examples are read from actual files in `proxy-examples/`
- Lines with `// HL` are highlighted in yellow
- OMIT markers show specific code sections

### Customization
- Edit `proxy-configuration.slide` to modify content
- Edit files in `proxy-examples/` to update code examples
- The present tool auto-reloads changes - just refresh browser

### Export to PDF
1. Open presentation in browser
2. Use browser print (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P)
3. Select "Save as PDF"
4. Settings: Landscape, No margins, Background graphics enabled

## Troubleshooting

**If port 3999 is in use:**
```bash
present -http=:8080
```
Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

**If present command not found:**
```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present@latest
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

**If code examples don't show:**
Make sure you're running `present` from the directory containing both the `.slide` file and the `proxy-examples/` directory.
